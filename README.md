### Project Title
Investigate a Dataset (TMBd Movie Data)

### Date created
Project is created on Feb 18th 2020.

### Description
In this project, I will conduct a data analysis over The Movie Database (TMDb) and create a file to share that documents the findings. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from TMDb, including over 20 indicators. This document will go through each step from data wrangling, statistical analyse, data visualize to draw conclusions.

### About
+ final report : investigate-a-dataset-template(TMDb).ipynb
+ dataset: tmdb-movies.csv
+ limitations: When we dealt with Nan and missing values, we simply dropped the records, there could be a better way to deal with Nan and missing values with further statistical test and investigate.
When we broke down genres for each movie, we 'duplicated' those records in other categories, this could affect the accuracy of some aggregations and calculations.
